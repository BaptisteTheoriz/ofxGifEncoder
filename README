ofxGifEncoder
-------------

Export animated gifs from openframeworks

USAGE:
	
	The important method is 
	
	ofxGifEncoder.save(vector <ofxGifFrame *> frames, string fileName, int nColors = 256);
	
	You give it a vector of ofxGifFrame pointers and it'll save an animated gif to the bin folder.

	ofxGifFrame is a struct (similar to ofPixels) which represents a single frame of the animation. 
	You can specify the width, height and duration in seconds (0.1f would be 10 fps).
	
	There is a convenience method ofxGifEncoder.createGifFrame() that facilitates this task.
	
CAVEATS:

	It will block your app while the gif is being saved, which might take a while with larger files.
	It only accepts rgb arrays for now.

TODO:
	- Implement freeimage's dithering.
	- Transaparent gifs!
	- Give the option to specify general fps instead of for each frame.
	- Thread the saving.
	- Provide option to choose palette?
